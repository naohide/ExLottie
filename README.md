**Example Animations:**
_multi-stage.json_ (Recommended - Shown in Prototype)

This approach would be best to use as we can fit multiple animations in one file making it easier to implement when multi stage animations are a benefit.

Contains three stages:
1. Frames 0-240 (Loop) - A basic movement to get attention.
2. Frames 240-360 - The main animation.
3. Frames 360-479 - Returns to the original state.

_single-stage.json_
Just the main animation from the multi-stage example. Simpler to implement for a quick test but less not as good in terms of what we can do. Can be used with both autoplay and looping disabled.

_simple.json_
Is a simpler version of the main animation. This could be used for a test if the other examples are too demanding (though they shouldnâ€™t be). Can be used with autoplay and looping disabled.
